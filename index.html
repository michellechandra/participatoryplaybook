             <p> “Over the years I have been invited into countless Cambodian homes to photograph. I have watched mothers and fathers pull out boxes of documents and photographs from the past, have witnessed as they share stories and experiences from the past with their children, often for the first time, as my grandmother had those years ago.” - Pete Pin</p>

            <p class="projecttext">More than three decades after the Killing Fields, the aftermath persists in the Cambodian American community. It is felt in the silence between generations. Cambodians who lived through the genocide not only remain silent because they do not know how to speak of what they lived through, but often because they literally do not speak the same language as their Cambodian American children. <strong>I Am Khmer</strong> is a participatory, community-based project in development that explores memory and identity in the Cambodian American community.</p><br />
            <p class="projecttext">While it has spanned many years and multiple cities I Am Khmer began with a single conversation between Pin and his grand-mother.  Through this powerful family moment, his Grandmother shared a photograph that changed his understanding of his family's history, and shifted the trajectory of his documentary practice.</p><br />
            <p class="projecttext">Throughout the project, Pete has sought to not only document a diverse and evolving community, but to use photography as a vehicle for sparking intergenerational dialogue and understanding.  While beginning as a traditional documentary project, I Am Khmer has since evolved to feature a national series of collaborative workshops where participants interview family members, document family photos, and work with Pin to tell their family's story.</p><br />
            <p class="projecttext">Over the years Pin has engaged a multitude of tactics and strategies for using photography as a tool for collaboration and community engagement. By revealing the evolution of his process we hope that this document will help others expand their own practice. Follow the timeline below for an abridged history of Pete’s process as he moved from first-person documentary storytelling to participatory practice.</p>

Have each student ask their subject, "What is one photograph or object that you would never want to let go?" Then have each student interview the person about why they chose that object, where they got it, and why it is important to them. Then take a portrait of the subject and a photograph of the chosen object. Come up with a creative way to include the text from the interview and combine with the images.</p>

The workshop brought local Cambodian youth together to connect with their families and work with their elders to look through family photos.

                 <p> Pete views the experience as incredibly important: “the act of looking for the photo can lead to insights, and that importantly, creating the space for young Cambodians to talk about these experiences was unique and incredibly powerful. So while we never made any photos, it gave me insights that help re-derect the entire project." However, new needs arise.  Looking back, there was no prepping the youth for their interactions at home. While there was no emphasis on interviewing family members many of the youth did. Since these conversations with elders can often lead to talking about traumatic events, Pete saw the importance of properly preparing participants. </p>

This leads to including the cell-phone image to polaroid copy component. Re-creating a tangible artifact from the experience that documents the history and interactive experience.</p>
