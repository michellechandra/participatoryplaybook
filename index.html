          <p>More than three decades after the Killing Fields, the aftermath persists in the Cambodian American community. It is felt in the silence between generations. Cambodians who lived through the genocide not only remain silent because they do not know how to speak of what they lived through, but often because they literally do not speak the same language as their Cambodian American children. </p>

          <p><strong>I Am Khmer</strong> is a participatory, community-based project in development in collaboration with the Cambodian Association of Greater Philadelphia, student groups and community leaders that explores memory and identity in the Cambodian American community.</p>
